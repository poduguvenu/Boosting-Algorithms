1. XGBoost - Customer Churn

  In this notebook we will use XGBoost to build a collection of boosted trees, and use continuous and categorical data from the IBM Base Samples to predict whether or not a customer will stop using a company's service. In business lingo, this is called Customer Churn.

2. XGBoost - Hyperparameter Optimization using RandomizedSearchCV
